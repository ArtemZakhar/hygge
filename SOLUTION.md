## Solution

I have not work with React for a while so it was interesting for me to implement the task using React ðŸ˜€
The main focus was to centralize query params updates and product data fetching. 
The useHandleSearchParams hook, in combination with useProductsWithParams handle the core functionality.

## Technology Stack

- **React** Library for building component-based UIs.
- **Tailwind** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Axios** HTTP client for communicating with backend services.
- **TanStack React Query** For fetching, caching, and updating server state in React applications.
- **React Router Dom** Client-side routing solution for React.

  â”œâ”€â”€â”€components  
  â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€â”€common                          # Common/shared components across the app

  â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€â”€useHandleSearchParams           # Centralized query parameter handling
  â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€â”€useQueryResponseHandler         # Handling fetch responses

  â”œâ”€â”€â”€styles                            # Global styling and theme configuration
  â”œâ”€â”€â”€types                             # TypeScript types
  â””â”€â”€â”€utils                             # Utility functions and helpers

## Notes
There were a few features I planned to implement, such as price range filter and product detailed page but due to personal time constraints I had to skip them.

Initially, I planned to use context for both: ProductList page and SideBar component. However the absence metadata in the API response forced me to separate the logic. I left the context only for short informational message in the SideBar component.
